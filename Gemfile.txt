#Since the gem is installed globally, we shouldn't need to install here with the bundle install to the project.  
#That is why data_record is commented out. 
#It's just here in the gem file for reference because we use this command to install this specifc gem: gem install "C:/Users/QuiTu/Desktop/Merge_Program/data_record-0.0.4.gem"
